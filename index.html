<h1>About me!</h1>

<p>Hi, my name's Olivia but all my friends call my Jules! I was born October 24, 2006 and graduated from Whitney Point High School with an overall ranking of eight. Enough of the boring stuff though. I'm a giant K-Pop fan and love the boy group P1Harmony, I play video games, and watch anime and asian dramas.</p>

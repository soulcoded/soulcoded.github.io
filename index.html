<h1>About me!</h1>

<p>Hi, my name's Olivia but all my friends call my Jules! I was born October 24, 2006 and graduated from Whitney Point High School with an overall ranking of eight. Enough of the boring stuff though. 
    I'm a giant K-Pop fan and love the boy group P1Harmony, I play video games, watch anime and asian dramas, and most of my friends live across the country. I used to draw and write throughout highschool 
    but have been too busy lately to continue.</p>

<p>I don't have a favorite food, so instead here's my favorite K-Pop idol!</p>
